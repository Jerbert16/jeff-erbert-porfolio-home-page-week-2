# Jeff Erbert Portfolio Page - Home - Week 2 - README

## Project Description:

A live web-based portfolio demonstrating coding competency gives a candidate a strong advantage when applying for developer roles. In fact, having one is almost an unwritten industry requirement. This home page, built from scratch, is the beginning of Jeff Erbert's web-based portfolio construction.  

At this phase, this page will be built using the following:
* Semantic HTML
* HTML
* CSS (incl. Flexbox, media queries, and variables)

**Note:** This is only the home page. The portfolio is still in its infancy so placeholder images and names may be used in areas.

## User Story:

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view Jeff Erbert's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of his work and assess whether he's a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria:

```
GIVEN I need to sample Jeff Erbert's previous work
WHEN I load his portfolio
THEN I am presented with the Jeff's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about him, his work, and how to contact him
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about his work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of his applications
WHEN I am presented with his first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
