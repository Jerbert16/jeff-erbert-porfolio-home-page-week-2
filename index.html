        <p>Armed with a wireless keyboard, an insatiable curiosity, and the
          unwavering belief that "normal" is just a setting on a washing
          machine, I'm here to harness the power of language, web development,
          and my digital marketing experience to help your organization thrive.</p>
          <p> For the past several years, I have worked in both the agency setting -- servicing clients with $1M+ ad spends -- and for an award-winning corporate content marketing machine. In both cases, I've witnessed first-hand how great content created fertile grounds for brand recognition, revenue, and growth. 
        </p>
        <p>Today, I'm focused on completing my University of Denver coding bootcamp to combine technical web-dev know-how with my creative side to truly push the boundaries of what's possible, and to deliver a user experience that truly improves lives.
